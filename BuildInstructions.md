# Building `LogoRRR` from source code

## Prerequisites

There are several apps you will have to install to successfully build `LogoRRR`, but it isn't overly complicated.

Given you have followed the instructions for [maven-gluonfx-plugin](https://github.com/gluonhq/gluonfx-maven-plugin) you
only have to provide the path to your GraalVM installation in the main pom.xml found at the root folder of the project.

## Fast forward

For the brave, there are build scripts in the main directory for each OS:

    linux.sh
    mac.sh
    win.bat

After configuring the project once properly, you can use those build scripts (which are trivial but handy) to
build `LogoRRR`.

### MacOs X

Following commands should get you a working environment. This is a fast way to install everything you'll need as far as
I remember.

    git clone https://github.com/rladstaetter/LogoRRR.git
    curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    sdk install maven 3.8.1
    sdk install java 22.3.r19-grl

([sdkman.io](https://sdkman.io) is a package manager specifically tailored for java development, you can install various
JVM based utilities / libraries and tools with it, manage different JVM versions as well - very handy!)

After this initial setup, you should be ready to build via maven. You have to adapt some paths in `pom.xml` - just
search for `graalvm.home` and make sure it is pointing to the correct path.

Execute

     mvn clean install

in the project directory (where `pom.xml` is located).

After spending some time compiling all necessary modules a binary executable which can be run without a JVM should be
available here:

    ./dist/dist-osx/binary-osx/target/gluonfx/x86_64-darwin/app.logorrr.dist.osx.binary

### Windows

To setup your Windows development environment, you have to perform following steps:

- Install Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition should suffice, tested with Visual Studio Professional)
- Gluon's build of GraalVM in a recent version (at least [22.0.0.2](https://github.com/gluonhq/graal/releases))
- (optionally) Install [Advanced Installer Suite](https://www.advancedinstaller.com) for creating installers (if you
  don't the build doesn't create installers)
- set `GRAALVM_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME` andy your PATH variable to use this JDK for your builds.

For my setup, those commands work:

    set GRAALVM_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\graalvm-svm-java11-windows-gluon-22.0.0.2-Final
    set JAVA_HOME=%GRAALVM_HOME%
    set PATH=%GRAALVM_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

After setting `graalvm.home` in the main pom.xml to your GraalVM Installation directory all you have to do to get to a
binary is:

     mvn clean install

A binary is available here after some minutes:

    ./dist/dist-win/binary-win/target/gluonfx/x86_64-windows/app.logorrr.dist.win.binary.exe

If you want to execute this exe on another computer, you have to make sure that the Visual Studio runtime dlls are
present there. If not, you can
download [Visual Studio 2019 redistributables here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). If the application
doesn't start - this is a possible reason for that.

### Linux

Setup on Linux is quite similar to Mac. You'll need at least `maven`, a `JDK` and a `GraalVM` installation.

My preferred way to get those tools is `apt` and `sdkman`, but this may vary on personal preferences. Use whatever fits
you best.

After installing all tools and configuring some paths in the `pom.xml` files a simple `mvn clean package` should do the
trick.

## Running from IntelliJ

The project contains run configurations for IntelliJ, which need a little bit of setup. This has to be done only once.

Change to the `env` directory and enter following command:

  init-ide.bat                  ... for Windows
  init-ide.sh                   ... for Mac or Linux

This will download the appropriate openjfx sdk which is needed to run LogoRRR from the IDE via the preconfigured run configuration. Thanks to [Gluon](https://www.gluonhq.com/) for providing pre built binaries of those SDKs!

A comprehensive tutorial how to get started with developing JavaFX can be found on [openjfx.io](https://openjfx.io).

## Configuring GraalVM native-image

**NOTE: at the moment the [Graalvm build is not active](https://github.com/rladstaetter/LogoRRR/issues/192)** 

`gluonfx-maven-plugin` helps to configure GraalVM compilation by providing a command which creates a configuration for
`native-image` by analysing the runtime behavior of an application. Navigate to the `./dist/dist-win/binary-win/` or
`./dist/dist-osx/binary-osx/` subdirectory and enter following command:

    mvn gluonfx:runagent

It will start `LogoRRR`. Now you have to execute all possible click paths - in your code repository configuration files
will appear in `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/`. Those files are different depending on which OS you execute
the application.

Currently, those files are checked in under src/main/native-image/<os>/, and via a maven configuration they are placed
in the right place needed for native-image. Like this the project can be build on multiple platforms via

    mvn clean install 

Implicitly, maven package will call `gluonfx:build` and create a binary executable.
